<h1>Memory Allocation</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Memory allocation is a crucial function of operating systems that determines how processes are loaded into memory.
        There are two main types: Contiguous and Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation.
    </p>

    <h2>Contiguous Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>
        In this method, each process is allocated a single contiguous block of memory.
        It is simple and fast but may lead to fragmentation.
    </p>

    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed Partitioning</strong> – Memory is divided into fixed-size partitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Variable Partitioning</strong> – Partitions are created dynamically as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Advantages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple to implement and manage</li>
            <li>Fast memory access due to contiguous layout</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Disadvantages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Leads to fragmentation</li>
            <li>Difficult to resize processes or partitions</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>
        Non-contiguous memory allocation allows a process to be divided into several blocks and loaded wherever there is free memory.
        This reduces fragmentation and improves memory utilization.
    </p>

    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paging</strong> – Divides memory into fixed-size pages and frames.</li>
        <li><strong>Segmentation</strong> – Divides programs based on logical segments (code, data, stack, etc).</li>
        <li><strong>Paging + Segmentation</strong> – Combines both concepts for more flexible allocation.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Advantages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces external fragmentation</li>
            <li>Efficient use of memory space</li>
            <li>Allows more flexible process loading</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Disadvantages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>More complex memory management</li>
            <li>May incur performance overhead due to address translation</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Buddy Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>
        Buddy Memory Allocation is a memory management technique that divides memory into partitions to satisfy memory requests efficiently. 
        It works by splitting memory into blocks of size 2^k and combines ("buddies") or splits them as needed.<br>
        When a request comes in, the allocator finds the smallest block of size 2^k that fits the request.<br>
        If a larger block is free, it is recursively split into two "buddies" of equal size.<br>
        When memory is freed, it is merged with its buddy if the buddy is also free, forming a larger block again.<br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Advantages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast Allocation and Deallocation: Due to the use of powers of two and simple binary operations, allocation and freeing are quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to Merge and Split: Buddies can be merged easily because their addresses differ by exactly one bit.</li>
            <li>Reduced External Fragmentation: Since memory is divided in powers of two, merging blocks becomes systematic, limiting fragmentation outside the allocated blocks.</li>
            <li>Simple Implementation: The logic is recursive and clean, making the system relatively easy to implement.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Disadvantages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal Fragmentation: A block of size 2^k is allocated even if a slightly smaller size is needed, wasting memory.</li>
            <li>Overhead in Splitting/Merging: Although fast, frequent splits and merges can introduce some overhead and complexity, especially in real-time systems.</li>
            <li>Power-of-Two Limitation: Requests not matching 2^k may lead to inefficient space usage.</li>
            <li>Limited Flexibility: Fixed-size blocks can be less adaptable compared to more dynamic allocators like slab or segregated fits.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
