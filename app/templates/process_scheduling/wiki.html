<h1>Process Scheduling</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Process scheduling is a vital task in the operating system's process manager, responsible for managing the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of the next process to execute based on specific scheduling strategies.</p>

    <p>In a multiprogramming operating system, multiple processes are loaded into memory and share the CPU using time multiplexing. The process scheduler ensures that the CPU is utilized effectively by deciding which process should run next.</p>

    <h2>Types of Process Schedulers</h2>
    <p>There are three main types of process schedulers, each serving a unique function in the system:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Long-Term or Job Scheduler</strong></dt>
        <dd>The long-term scheduler selects processes from the pool of new processes and moves them to the 'Ready State'. It controls the degree of multiprogramming by managing the number of processes in the ready queue at any time. This scheduler ensures a balanced mix of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes, maximizing system efficiency.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Short-Term or CPU Scheduler</strong></dt>
        <dd>The short-term scheduler is responsible for selecting a process from the ready state and assigning it to the CPU for execution. It uses scheduling algorithms to decide which process runs next. The CPU scheduler ensures that no process starves by managing CPU time allocation effectively.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Medium-Term Scheduler</strong></dt>
        <dd>The medium-term scheduler handles process suspension and resumption. It is responsible for swapping processes in and out of main memory to optimize memory use. This scheduler also helps maintain an ideal balance between I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes by adjusting the degree of multiprogramming as needed.</dd>
    </dl>
